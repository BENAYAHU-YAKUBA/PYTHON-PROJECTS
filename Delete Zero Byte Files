Script Name: ZeroByte DotFix Cleaner
What It Does:
This script scans a specified directory and deletes zero-byte files, including those that have a dot (.) at the end in 
Windows. Since Windows has restrictions on handling such files, the script uses extended path syntax (\\?\) to properly 
detect and remove them.
"""

# Set the directory path (change this to your target directory)
directory = r"C:\Users\xxxr\Desktop"

# Use glob to find files ending with a dot
for file_path in glob.glob(os.path.join(directory, "*.")):  # Matches files ending with "."
    full_path = f"\\\\?\\{file_path}"  # Windows extended path syntax
    if os.path.getsize(full_path) == 0:  # Check if file is zero-byte
        os.remove(full_path)  # Delete the file
        print(f"Deleted: {file_path}")

print("Zero-byte files ending with a dot deleted successfully.")
